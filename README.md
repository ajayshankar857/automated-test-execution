Automated Test Execution Platform:

     A backend-driven Automated Test Execution Platform built using Spring Boot that allows users to centrally manage test cases, execute them automatically, and analyze execution results through REST APIs and database verification.
     This project demonstrates real-world backend architecture, clean separation of concerns, and a foundation that can be extended to full-scale automation frameworks.
